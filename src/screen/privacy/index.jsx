							Privacy Statement
						</h3>
						<p>
							Capseed recognises the importance of personally
							identifiable information collected about you and are
							strongly committed to protecting this information
							when you interact with us about our products and
							services. It is our objective to create a
							transparent framework about how and why we collect
							and use your personal information, and how we
							safeguard your privacy. We are bound by the relevant
							laws including the Australian Privacy Principles in
							the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Privacy (Credit
							Reporting) Code and Freedom of Information Act 1982
							in relation to the handling of personal information.

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">
							Personal Information
						</h3>
						<p>
							We collect personal information when we provide our
							products and services to you, and only collect
							personal information that is reasonably necessary
							for us to perform our functions. Generally, we will
							tell you why we are collecting information when we
							collect it and how we plan to use it, or these
							things will be obvious when we collect the
							information.
						</p>
						<p>
							We usually collect personal information directly
							from you although sometimes we may need to source
							information about you from a third party: for
							example, a credit reporting body or an insurer.
							Wherever possible this will be done with your
							permission or where this is not possible, we will
							inform you. We may also acquire lists from other
							sources, both from other companies and from public
							documents.
						</p>
						<p>
							The kind of personal information we collect, and
							hold will depend upon the type of products and
							services that you request, and may include:
						</p>

							Credit Information
						</h3>
						<p>
							This section applies in addition to other sections

							provided with finance. Credit information obtained
							includes your credit history including repayment
							history, default information, details of any serious
							infringements, personal insolvency information and
							any other publicly available information. In
							obtaining your credit history from a credit
							reporting body, we are required to advise them of

							information with a number of parties including:
							prospective investors who have an interest in
							financing your loan; any party representing you such
							your broker, lawyer or accountant; anyone who you
							have provided consent; credit reporting bodies; our

							body to correct your information. We make use of
							Equifax. Refer www.equifax.com.au or telephone 13 83

							services and if the law requires us to. We will only
							collect sensitive information about you with your
							consent, for example if assessing a hardship
							application.
						</p>

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">Anonymity</h3>

							your personal information. However, if you don’t, we
							might be unable to fulfil your request for a

							you to protect you against fraud.

						</p>

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">
							Use by Third Parties
						</h3>
						<p>
							Wherever our business is outsourced to third party
							service providers, such as our lawyers, information
							technology service providers, we undertake wherever
							possible to ensure that these parties are bound by
							confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.
							Information provided to these parties remains the
							property of Capseed and is only used for the
							specific purpose for which it is supplied. Wherever
							possible Capseed will elect to deal with agents who
							are bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act.
							Except where required by law, we only disclose
							personal information to third parties with your
							express or implied consent. We do not disclose names
							and addresses to third parties for their own use and
							in particular we do not disclose names and addresses
							to third parties for their direct marketing.
							Generally, we require third parties to protect your
							information in the same way we do.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may share your information with companies which
							are related to the Capseed group so that products
							and services may be offered.
						</p>
						<p>
							We do not normally deal with overseas entities. If
							your personal information is disclosed to a company
							operating in a foreign country, we will ensure that
							the information will be protected by a law or in a
							contract which upholds privacy principles similar to
							the Australian Privacy Principles.
						</p>

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">
							Use of Aggregate Data
						</h3>
						<p>
							Using cookies, we may collect certain non-personal

							including our web pages for your computer. This
							information is for example the identity of your
							internet browser, the type of operating system you
							use, your IP address and the domain name of your
							internet service provider. We may use such
							non-personal information for internal purposes,
							including but not limited to improving the content

						</p>

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">Security</h3>
						<p>
							We take all reasonable precautions to protect your
							personal information from loss, unauthorised access,
							modification, and unauthorised disclosure. Personal
							information about your accounts and membership is
							only accessible by you and those who are authorised
							to access it. Only authorised employees have access
							to your personal information and only for approved
							purposes. Your personal information can only be
							amended and deleted by authorised means. Records
							that we hold, containing your personal information
							may be in hardcopy documents or electronic data. We
							use a variety of physical and electronic security
							measures including restricting physical access to
							our offices and firewalls, virus software, user
							identities and passwords and secure databases to
							keep personal information secure from misuse, loss
							or unauthorised use or disclosure. Our website uses
							technology to ensure maximum security.
							Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
							Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">
							Data Breaches
						</h3>
						<p>
							Security of your personal information is very
							important to us. Capseed have implemented internal
							procedures to manage data breaches if they occur.
						</p>
						<p>
							A data breach occurs when personal information that
							an organisation holds is subject to unauthorised
							access or disclosure, or is lost. A data breach may
							be caused by malicious action (by an external or
							insider party), human error, or a failure in
							information handling or security systems. Capseed
							will notify you and the Office of the Australian
							Information Commissioner about any eligible data
							breaches as required by law. An ‘eligible data
							breach’ is a breach that is likely to result in
							serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the
							information relates, and we have not been able to
							prevent this risk of serious harm with remedial
							action.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you believe that we have experienced a data
							breach, please contact us using details in the
							section “Contacting Us”.
						</p>

						<h3 className="text-md font-bold mt-4">
							Direct Marketing

							partners, affiliates and any proposed new or
							incoming insurer may offer.

							You can opt out of receiving direct marketing
							information from us at any time by contacting us

							an administrative fee, of which we will inform you
							in advance.
